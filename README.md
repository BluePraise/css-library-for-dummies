#CSS LIBRARY FOR DUMMIES

### (or people that don't care)

I have made this library, because I noticed a lot of people resort to
bootstrap or w3.css.
For some people, I shan't name names or point fingers, css has become a deathtrap.
I have no problem with this coupling, but I do have a problem with the semantics.

When using a library, there is a slight learning curve of comprehending the classnames
attached to certain behaviour or aesthetic.

So, I have ventured to make a library with classnames that should be as simple as possible.
Feel free to make suggestions if you can do better.

It makes use of normalize to make sure it won't be a mess on all the browsers.
It makes use of display flex... because i don't know why, really, but I just thought I'd
put it in for good measure.
